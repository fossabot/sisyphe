  <title>Impaired Prepulse Inhibition of Acoustic Startle in Schizophrenia</title>
  <abstract>Schizophrenics show deficits in sensorimotor gating, as measured by prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle (PPI). The goal of this investigation is to further characterize PPI and habituation deficits in schizophrenia, and to examine whether differing subgroups of schizophrenics would show comparable PPI deficits. Methods: PPI was measured in 24 male schizophrenic subjects (9 acutely decompensated inpatients and 15 stable outpatients) and in 20 age-matched normal control subjects. Schizophrenic subjects were rated for positive and negative symptoms at the time of testing. Results: Schizophrenic subjects showed deficits in prepulse inhibition and habituation as compared to normal subjects. Similar latency facilitation was produced by the prepulse in both groups. Acutely decompensated inpatients and stable outpatients did not differ in percent PPI. PPI did not correlate with severity of positive or negative symptoms.Conclusions: These results suggest that schizophrenic subjects have impaired central inhibitory mechanisms as measured by PPI, and support the hypothesis that periods ofrelative clinical remission are not accompanied by normalization of sensorimotor gating</abstract>
  <introduction>Schizophrenic patients are characterized by significant deficits in attention and information processing (Braff and Geyer 1990). Cognitive impairments include the inability to filter distracting, trivial, and nonsalient stimuli. In McGhie and Chapman s view (1961), this inability to gate or screen out the  otherwise chaotic flow of informa tion reaching consciousness  results in overstimulation and cognitive disintegration. Such  sensorimotor gating deficits  are hypothesized to contribute to sensory overload, thought disorder, and other psychotic symptoms. The acoustic startle response is a cross-species reflexive contraction of the skeletal musculature in response to strong exteroceptive stimuli (Davis 1984). In humans, the eyeblink component of startle may be quantified using electromyographic (EMG) measurement of the orbicularis oculi facial muscle responses elicited by the startling stimuli. Sensorimotor gating is assessed by measuring the ability to inhibit the response to a startling stimulus that is immediately preceded by a weak prestimulus. Graham (1975), adapting a startle modification paradigm used in animal research (Hoffman and Searle 1968), demonstrated that a weak prestimulus could effectively inhibit the startle response in human subjects, a phenomenon now known as prepulse inhibition (PPI). The effects of the prepulse on the startle reflex include amplitude inhibition (smaller blinks) as well as reduced latency of blink onset and latency to peak amplitude (faster blinks). PPI is thought to reflect an automatic, involuntary, preattentive inhibitory process that functions to protect the initial processing of the prepulse (Graham and Murray 1977). Schizophrenic patients, hypothesized to suffer from a lack of gating functions leading to sensory flooding and cognitive fragmentation, were first shown to have decreased PPI of startle by Braff et al (1978). Subsequent work with the PPI paradigm in schizophrenic subjects has shown significantly less PPI both across short lead intervals (ranging between 30 and 120 msec) and across a broad range of prepulse intensities (Braff et al 1999; Grillon et al 1992), using acoustic, tactile (Braff et al 1992), and electrocutaneous (Bolino et al 1994) startling stimuli. It has also been demonstrated that schizophrenic subjects exhibit deficits in habituation (a decrement in startle amplitude over repeated presentations of initially novel stimuli) (Bolino et al 1992; Braff et al 1978; Geyer and Braff 1982). Deficits in central inhibition and sensorimotor gating are believed to be fundamental trait-linked markers in schizophrenia (Braff 1993). Deficits in PPI have been demonstrated both in chronic and acutely ill schizophrenic subjects (Braff et al 1978, 1992). While earlier work with the PPI paradigm involved heterogeneous groups of psychotic patients, Dawson et al (1993) demonstrated PPI deficits in the active attend condition in recent-onset schizophrenic subjects, lending further support to the hypothesis that PPI deficits are trait linked. Further evidence for PPI as a trait-related deficit has been demonstrated by the study of individuals hypothesized to be in the schizophrenia spectrum of disorders but who do not have the confounding effects of overt psychosis. Both schizotypal personality disordered patients (Cadenhead et al 1993) and  psychosis-prone  individuals, tested both in a passive attend condition (Simons and Giardina 1992) and in an active task paradigm (Schell et al 1995), have been shown to have deficits in PPI similar to the deficits seen in schizophrenia (Swerdlow et al 1995). The aims of this study were to 1) replicate previous results indicating deficits in PPI in schizophrenic patients compared to normal subjects as reported by Braff et al (1992); 2) to examine the relationship of PPI to the positive and negative symptom dimensions in this group of schizophrenic patients; and 3) to preliminarily address the issue of whether PPI is a trait-related deficit. To accomplish this, PPI was compared in a subgroup of acutely decompensated inpatients and a subgroup of clinically stable outpatients.</introduction>
  <methods_and_materials>Informed consent was obtained from 24 schizophrenic patients and 20 demographically matched normal control subjects under an IRB approved protocol. All subjects were right-handed men. Five schizophrenic subjects and 2 normal subjects were excluded from data analysis due to inadequate startle amplitude to pulse alone stimuli (see criteria in  Results ). The subjects with schizophrenia, diagnosed using criteria of the DSM-IV established by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), were recruited from the inpatient and outpatient departments of the New York Veterans Administration Medical Center. Potential subjects were excluded if they had any other Axis I psychiatric disorder, significant medical or neurologic illness, history of substance abuse or dependence (excluding nicotine and caffeine), or any history of head trauma or loss of consciousness. The schizophrenic group consisted of 15 clinically stable outpatients and 9 inpatients tested within 3 days of emergency admission to an acute psychiatric unit for acute psychotic decompensation. Of the 15 stable outpatients, all except one were taking antipsychotic medications; 7 were maintained on typical neuroleptics, 1 on risperidone, and 1 on clozapine. A subset of patients were maintained on lorazepam (n  2), trazodone (n  1), fluoxetine (n  2), sertraline (n  2), inderal (n  1), and valproate (n  1) in addition to their neuroleptic as augmentation strategies. At the time of admission, 5 out of the 9 acutely decompensated inpatients had been noncompliant with their neuroleptic medications for over 1 month. The acutely decompensated patients received between 1 and 3 doses of neuroleptic on a PRN basis, often in conjunction with a benzodiazepine to control acute agitation during the time between their admission and their testing. Table 1 shows demographic, diagnostic, and medication information for the acutely decompensated and stable outpatient subsets of schizophrenic subjects. At the time of startle testing, the subjects with schizophrenia were examined using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Positive and Negative Symptom Subscale (PANSS), and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS). Both total and subscale scores were used to assess positive and negative symptoms. The normal subjects were hospital employees or volunteers who were screened using the SCID part I and II to rule out any Axis I or II psychiatric disorders. Exclusion criteria for this group also included any history of psychiatric disorders or treatment in the subjects  first-degree relatives, medical or neurologic illness, any current medications, any history of loss of consciousness, and any history of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence. Startle Response Measurement All subjects were initially screened for hearing within normal limits using an audiometer (Model GS1710, Grason-Stadler, Milford, NH). No subjects were excluded on the basis of hearing deficit. Methodology for measuring PPI was similar to that of Braff et al (1992). The acoustic startle response (eyeblink component) was measured via EMG of the right orbicularis oculi muscle. Two 5 mm silver/silver chloride electrodes filled with gel were positioned approximately 1 cm under the pupil and 1 cm below the lateral canthus, and a ground electrode was placed behind the right ear over the mastoid. All resistances were less than 6 kilo-ohms. Electromyographic (EMG) activity was amplified and digitized using a computerized EMG startle response monitoring system (SR-LAB, San Diego Instruments, San Diego). Amplifier gain was held constant at 1.0 for all subjects. The system was set to record 250 1-msec readings starting at the onset of the startle (pulse alone) stimulus. Subjects were seated in a chair next to the recording equipment and asked to look straight ahead and keep their eyes open during the test session. All acoustic stimuli were delivered binaurally through headphones (TDH-39-P, Maico, Minneapolis). The startle session began with a three-minute acclimation period consisting of 70 dB (A) broadband noise, which continued as the background noise throughout the session. The pulse alone stimulus was a 116 dB (A), 40 msec duration burst of pure tone with a near instantaneous rise time; the prepulse stimuli were 85 dB (A) 20 msec bursts of pure tone presented 30, 60, and 120 msec prior to the startle stimulus. The startle session consisted of six blocks of 12 trials, for a total of 72 startle stimuli. Each block consisted of three pulse alone trials plus three trials of prepulse plus pulse at each of the three designated interstimulus intervals (30, 60, and 120 msec), presented in a pseudorandom order. Each session began with an initial pulse alone trial. Inter-trial intervals were 11 to 45 sec (average 26 sec). Pulse amplitudes are reported in machine digital units, where each digital unit equals 1.221 V. Digital signals were smoothed by an averaging routine that calculates a rolling average of the digital signals, where the number of digital signals averaged is 10. The minimum response criterion for a peak was set at 10 arbitrary amplitude units. Subjects whose mean pulse alone amplitude in the first block was below 25 units (stable outpatients n  5; normal subjects n  2) were excluded from subsequent analyses, in accordance with the criteria for nonstartlers established by Braff et al (1992). The final sample for startle analyses thus included 19 schizophrenic subjects (9 acutely decompensated inpatients; 10 stable outpatients) and 18 normal control subjects. The onset latency (latency from stimulus to commencement of blink reflex) is defined by a shift of 6 digit units from the baseline value, occurring 21 to 120 msec after the pulse alone stimulus. Peak latency (latency from stimulus to maximum blink amplitude) is defined as the point of maximal amplitude occurring within 150 msec from the pulse alone stimulus. Responses in which onset and peak latencies differed by more than 95 msec were considered to be artifactual (not generated by the stimulus) and were discarded. Trials were also discarded if excessive EMG activity was observed during the first 20 msec of recording. Less than 5% of the trials were discarded in both the schizophrenic and normal control groups using these parameters. On trials in which no scorable blink occurred (4.6% of all trials), amplitude was recorded as zero. Statistical Analysis Various analysis of variance (ANOVA) models were calculated on mean raw amplitude values and percent prepulse inhibition values (calculated as [(mean pulse alone  mean prepulse)/mean pulse alone]  100). Overall ANOVA models included the between-subject factor of group (2 levels: schizophrenic and normal control subjects) and the within-subject factors of prepulse type (3 or 4 levels: 30 msec, 60 msec, 120 msec prepulse, and pulse alone [for raw data]), and  block  (6 levels: blocks 1 to 6). Significant overall ANOVA models were followed up with a reduced group  Prepulse Type 2-factor ANOVA design using only block 1 data (dropping the block factor), assuming the presence of habituation across the 6 blocks (tested with a group  block ANOVA on the mean pulse alone values). For the latency data, a group  block ANOVA on pulse alone trials was performed on the blocks 1 to 6 mean onset and mean peak latency values to assess latency habituation effects (the latency data were discarded when no blink occurred to minimize confounding). A follow-up group  prepulse type ANOVA on collapsed data from blocks 1 to 3 was performed to assess latency facilitation effects (data from blocks 1 to 3 were only used to circumvent confounds arising from reduced numbers of analyzable responses in later blocks). All significant main and interaction effects were followed up with appropriate post-hoc tests. Spearman correlations were computed between amplitude and latency measures, as well as among the startle data, demographic variables, and the clinical rating scales.</methods_and_materials>
  <results>Demographic and Clinical Characteristics The demographic and clinical characteristics for the 19 schizophrenic startlers are shown in Table 1. Five of the 24 schizophrenic (20.8%) and 2 of the 20 normal control subjects (10.0%) were dropped from the PPI analysis because they were nonstartlers (this group difference was not significant, as determined by a  analysis). The 5 schizophrenic nonstartlers (all stable outpatients) were not significantly different from the remaining 19 schizophrenic startlers in terms of measures of positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and overall clinical symptomatology, as assessed by the BPRS, PANSS, and SANS. The schizophrenic and normal control groups were not significantly different  with respect to age  and educational level). Startle Amplitude and Habituation Differences in raw pulse alone (startle) amplitude values across blocks 1 to 6 were examined between schizophrenic and normal control subjects with a group (2)  block (6) ANOVA design. In this model, the main effect of the block was significant , the main effect of group was a nonsignificant trend [F(1,35)  3.08; p .0880], and the group  block interaction was nonsignificant. This overall pattern of Overall group  ANOVA model had the following F values: group, prepulse type block, group  prepulse type, ;  prepulse type  block, F (15,21)  5.30, p  .0003; group  prepulse type  block, F (15,21)  0.27, p  .9940. For simple main effects: SZ, differences across block/prepulse type for schizophrenic subjects only; NC, differences across block/prepulse type for normal control subjects only; B1-B6, group differences at each of the six blocks; P-A, group differences at pulse alone; P-30, group differences at 30 msec prepulse condition; PP-60, group differences at 60 msec prepulse condition; PP-120, group differences at 120 msec prepulse condition. results indicates habituation in startle amplitudes (i.e., lowering) across blocks 1 to 6 and a nonsignificant trend for schizophrenic subjects generally having higher startle amplitudes than normal control subjects. Means, standard deviations, and follow-up simple main effects on the raw pulse alone values are provided in the top section of Table 2. An alternative analysis of habituation, using a one-way ANOVA comparing the percentage change from block 1 to block 6 in pulse alone amplitudes, yielded a significant difference between the groups [mean  SD: schizophrenic group 38.9%  30.3; normal group  56.4%  22.9; F(1,35)  3.89; p  .05], indicating lessened habituation in the patient group. Raw Amplitude Analysis of Inhibition Differences in raw amplitude prepulse values (with pulse alone) between schizophrenic (n  19) and normal control subjects (n  18) were significant according to the overall group (2)  prepulse type (4)  block (6) ANOVA design (see Table 2 note). The reduced group (2)  prepulse type (4) ANOVA model on the raw amplitude block 1 data revealed significant effects for group [F(1,35)  6.33; p  .0166] and prepulse type [F(5,31)  28.43; p  .0001], but the group  prepulse type interaction was not significant (Figure 1). This pattern of results indicates that there are overall group and prepulse type differences with respect to the raw amplitude data. Follow-up simple main effects (Table 2, middle section) revealed that raw pulse alone values were not significantly different for the 2 groups; however, schizophrenics had significantly higher raw values for the 30, 60, and 120 msec prepulse types, indicating significantly poorer inhibition for these 3 trial conditions relative to normal control subjects. Percent Inhibition Analysis The group (2)  prepulse type (3) ANOVA model for the percent inhibition data for block 1 revealed significant effects for group [F(1,35)  10.83; p  .0023] and a prepulse type [F(2,34)  12.91; p  .0001], but not for the group  prepulse type interaction (Figure 1 inset). Follow-up simple main effects indicated that schizophrenic subjects had significantly lower percent inhibition values than normal controls for the 30 and 120 msec prepulse types, and a nonsignificant trend for lower percent inhibition was observed for the 60 msec prepulse condition. Onset and Peak Latencies Normal and schizophrenic patients did not differ in their mean onset latencies on pulse alone trials. The main effect for block was significant [F(5,31)  5.32; p  .000], with shorter onset latencies occurring in the early blocks. There was a trend towards a significant group by block interaction [F(5,31)  2.15; p  .06], suggesting that schizophrenic subjects had decreased habituation (longer onset latency) across blocks 1 to 6. There were no group differences in peak latencies in the pulse alone condition across blocks 1 to 6. The effects of the prepulse condition on onset and peak latency (as compared to the pulse alone condition) were examined across blocks 1 to 3 to minimize the influence of habituation. An analysis of onset latencies showed no main effects of group and a highly significant main effect of prepulse condition [F(3,105)  11.72; p  .00], reflecting the fact that for both normal and schizophrenic subjects, a prepulse significantly shortened onset latencies, as compared with latencies in the pulse alone condition. Post-hoc Newman-Keuls tests of pairwise combinations showed significant onset latency facilitation in the 30 msec prepulse condition (p  .0001) and the 60 msec prepulse condition (p  .03). A similar analysis of peak latencies also showed no significant group difference. There was a highly significant condition effect [F(3,105)  31.70; p  .00), with all subjects showing significant peak latency facilitation in all three prepulse-pulse intervals—30, 60, and 120 msec (p  .0001 in all conditions). Acutely Decompensated Inpatients versus Stable Outpatients The 19 schizophrenic startlers were classified as either stable (n  10) or acutely decompensated patients (n  9) according to the criteria outlined in the  Methods  section. The demographic and clinical variables for these two subgroups of schizophrenic subjects are shown in Table 1 (right half). The acutely decompensated subgroup had significantly higher total and positive subscale BPRS and PANSS scores than did the group of stable outpatients (Table 1). Differences between stable and acutely decompensated schizophrenic subjects in raw pulse alone (startle) amplitude values across blocks 1 to 6 were not significant in schizophrenia type (2)  block (6) ANOVA design. In addition, there were no significant differences between stable and acutely decompensated schizophrenic subjects in the group effects from the overall schizophrenic type  prepulse type  block ANOVA models and the reduced schizophrenic type  prepulse type models on block 1 data using the raw amplitude prepulse values and percent inhibition data. No group differences were observed in onset and peak latency measures between acutely decompensated and chronic stable schizophrenic subjects. Taken together, the results indicate that there is no evidence for differences in prepulse phenomena between stable and acutely decompensated schizophrenic subjects with the methods used in the present study. Correlations between PPI and Clinical Data Spearman correlations (rs) were computed between the prepulse variables (pulse alone amplitude, pulse alone latency, percent inhibition, and prepulse latency) and the demographic variables (age and duration of illness) and the psychiatric ratings (total scores, positive symptom scores, and negative symptom scores for the BPRS, PANSS, and SANS) for all 19 schizophrenic patients. Two correlations were significant after correction for Type I error (alpha level set was at .01, two-tailed). Pulse alone amplitude was found to be inversely related to age (rs  .67, p  .01) and to duration of illness).</results>
  <discussion>The results of this study confirm prior observations (Bolino et al 1994; Braff et al 1978, 1992, 1999; Grillon et al 1992) that schizophrenic patients have reduced sensorimotor gating as measured by impaired prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response. Among the subjects with schizophrenia, acutely decompensated inpatients did not differ in PPI from stable medicated outpatients. Deficits in prepulse inhibition were observed across all prepulse-to-pulse intervals in block 1, with 120 msec condition being the most effective in eliciting prepulse inhibition in both groups. The magnitude of deficits observed in the schizophrenic subjects in this study are very similar to those reported by Braff et al (1992): percent prepulse inhibition in the 120 msec condition in block 1 for schizophrenics in that study was 59.4% compared with 57.1% for the patients in the current study. Our data indicate that both normal and schizophrenic subjects demonstrate latency facilitation in the 30 msec prepulse condition, which finding is also in accord with prior work (Braff et al 1992). The latency facilitation in prepulse trials seen in schizophrenic subjects indicates that PPI deficits in schizophrenic subjects are a specific phenomenon related to startle amplitude reduction, and are not due to a failure to detect the prepulse or a manifestation of a more generalized deficit in auditory processing (Braff et al 1992). With regard to habituation, startle amplitude in normal subjects decreased by 56% over the test session, while schizophrenic patients showed only 39% habituation. The group difference was significant in a one-way ANOVA of percent change between block 1 and block 6, although the ANOVA on startle amplitudes across the six blocks detected differences between the groups only at a trend level. Geyer and Braff (1982) reported significantly reduced habituation in schizophrenic compared with normal or patient control subjects ( 50% vs. 70%) in a paradigm with 121 pulse alone trials. Bolino et al (1992) likewise noted reduced habituation in schizophrenic subjects in a paradigm consisting only of pulse alone trials. In a later study by Braff et al (1992), which used a paradigm that was less specific for measuring habituation, both schizophrenic and normal subjects habituated across the test session, although without significant differences between the groups in the early blocks of the session. The less robust habituation deficits in our study may be related to the lower number of pulse alone trials and the admixture of pulse alone and prepulse trials. As suggested by Braff et al (1992), startle habituation effects are best measured using large series of pulse alone stimuli to avoid any interactions, since the prepulse stimulus has differential effects on both groups of patients. Deficits in PPI have been proposed as a biologic marker of schizophrenia (Braff 1993; Swerdlow and Geyer 1998). Our failure to detect gating differences between the subset of stable outpatients and the acutely decompensated inpatients supports this concept. The acute subgroup had more severe symptoms, as indicted by significantly greater scores on the BPRS and PANSS, which had led to their needing to be rehospitalized. If clinical improvements were accompanied by improvements in sensorimotor gating, the stable outpatients should have had mean PPI intermediate between the acutely decompensated inpatients and the normal subjects. Unlike prior studies, which have suggested that neuroleptic treatment improves gating in schizophrenics (Kumari et al 1998; Wu et al 1992), our outpatient subjects demonstrated less PPI than the acutely decompensated inpatient sample (50% vs. 64% for the 120 msec trial type in block 1). Our sample size for an analysis of subgroup differences was small; therefore, we cannot rule out Type II error in failing to detect significant differences between the inpatients and outpatients. The clinical heterogeneity of the two subgroups may also have impeded our ability to detect PPI differences between the subgroups. Although the acutely decompensated patients had a greater level of symptomatology (as measured by BPRS and PANSS global and positive subscale scores) as compared to the stable outpatients, some of the outpatients were noted to be poor neuroleptic responders and to have higher overall levels of both negative symptoms and general psychopathology at their baseline than did some of the acutely decompensated patients. Our study does not permit conclusions regarding the role of medication in PPI disruption. Although the inpatient subjects had all been at least partially noncompliant with neuroleptic treatment prior to their admission, most of them received at least one dose of neuroleptic on a PRN basis during the 1 to 3 days between their admission and their startle testing, and one of the outpatients was remaining stable on no neuroleptic. A longitudinal study examining the same schizophrenic subjects both during acute psychotic decompensation and during relatively asymptomatic periods would help to clarify these issues. Cognitive theories of schizophrenia have hypothesized that defects in filtering or gating sensory input may lead to the development of positive and negative symptoms (Venables 1964). Recent work with the PPI paradigm has demonstrated a positive correlation between PPI deficits in schizophrenic patients and the presence of thought disorder (Perry and Braff 1994; Perry et al 1999). In these studies, deficient PPI was found to correlate significantly with the inability to screen out interoceptive stimuli elicited by Rorschach cards. Similarly, distractibility in schizophrenic patients has also been linked to impairments in PPI (Karper et al 1996). A more recent study (Braff et al 1999) reported significant correlations between prepulse inhibition and both positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenic subjects. We did not find significant correlations between clinical ratings, including thought form, and PPI. This could be because our sample size was not sufficient, since prior studies which have found correlations between PPI and clinical ratings have had larger sample sizes (Braff et al 1999; Karper et al 1996; Perry and Braff 1994; Perry et al 1999). In summary, the results of this study supplement prior observations that schizophrenic subjects demonstrate deficits in prepulse inhibition in the acoustic startle paradigm (Braff 1978; Braff et al 1992, 1999; Grillon et al 1992). Both acutely decompensated and clinically stable schizophrenic subjects had significantly decreased sensorimotor gating compared to normal subjects, and were not significantly different from each other. The lack of any PPI differences in acutely decompensated inpatients versus clinically stable outpatients, and the lack of significant correlations of PPI with positive or negative symptomatology, supports the concept that PPI deficits reflect an enduring abnormality in schizophrenia, and that periods of relative clinical remission are not accompanied by normalization of sensorimotor gating.
